## 🛠️ Deployment Plan

### Phase 1: Setup  
- [x] Install Windows Server 2019  
- [x] Configure DNS, DHCP, and Static IP  
- [x] Promote to Domain Controller  
- [x] Join Windows 10 Client to Domain  

### Phase 2: Core AD Exploration  
- [x] Create Organizational Units (OUs)  
- [x] Add Users/Groups  
- [x] Apply Group Policy Objects (GPOs)  
- [x] Enable and Analyze Event Logging

## 🧠 Lessons Learned (So Far)

- **Understanding of FSMO roles**
- **Importance of DNS in domain resolution**
- **How GPOs can restrict or empower users**
- **Security risks of misconfigured AD environments**

---

## 🖼️ Screenshots

_Add screenshots of Server Manager, DNS configs, ADUC (`dsa.msc`), GPO Editor, etc._

---

## 🚨 Next Phase: Detection & Defense

> Implement Sysmon, explore Windows Defender logs, and simulate basic attacks using tools like SharpHound and invoke-mimikatz (in safe, isolated test).
